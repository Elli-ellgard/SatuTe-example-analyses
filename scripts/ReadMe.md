# Scripts Folder README

## Overview

This folder contains all the scripts necessary for performing various downstream analyses using SatuTe. Each type of analysis is organized into its own subfolder, where you can find the corresponding script(s) required to execute the analysis. These scripts are equipped with examples from the `example` folder within this repository. To run the analyses individually, navigate to the specific directory and execute the script.

For example:

    ``` bash
    cd /per_category_analysis/
    python3 script_category_analysis.py 
    ```

The output generated by each script will be saved in the `example` folder.
