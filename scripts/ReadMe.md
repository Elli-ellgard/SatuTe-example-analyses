# Scripts Folder README

## Overview

This folder contains all the scripts necessary for performing various downstream analyses using SatuTe. Each type of analysis is organized into its own subfolder, where you can find the corresponding script(s) required to execute the analysis. These scripts are equipped with examples from the `example` folder within this repository. The output generated by each script will be saved in the `example` folder.

| **Analysis Type**                   | **Example Output Folder**           |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| per-category analysis               | `example/results_per_category_analysis/`    |
| branch-specific sliding-window analysis | `example/results_sliding_window_analysis/`   |
| per-alignment region analysis       | `example/results_per_region_analysis/`     |
| z-score differences  between branches               | `example/z_score_differences_branches/`      |
| z-score differences  between topologies               | `example/z_score_differences_topologies/`      |


## Requirements

Before running any scripts, make sure you have the following software and packages installed:

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

If you want to run the Tree of Life analysis, make sure you have additionally installed: 

- **SatuTe**: The SatuTe tool itself should be installed.
- **IQ-TREE**: Although not necessary for running the example scripts, IQ-TREE may be required for full analyses.
