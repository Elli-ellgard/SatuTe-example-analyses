# Scripts Folder README

## Overview

This folder contains all the scripts necessary for performing various downstream analyses using SatuTe. Each type of analysis is organized into its own subfolder, where you can find the corresponding script(s) required to execute the analysis. These scripts are equipped with examples from the `example` folder within this repository. The output generated by each script will be saved in the `example` folder.

| **Analysis Type**                   | **Example Output Folder**           |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| per-category analysis               | `example/results_per_category_analysis/`    |
| branch-specific sliding-window analysis | `example/results_sliding_window_analysis/`   |
| per-alignment region analysis       | `example/results_per_region_analysis/`     |
| z-score differences  between branches               | `example/z_score_differences_branches/`      |
| z-score differences  between topologies               | `example/z_score_differences_topologies/`      |

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following software installed before running any scripts:

- **Python 3.x**: Confirm that Python is installed on your system.

For those interested in running the Tree of Life analysis, the following additional tools are required:

- **SatuTe**: Make sure the SatuTe tool is installed.
- **IQ-TREE**: Although not needed for the example scripts, IQ-TREE is essential for performing full-scale analyses.
